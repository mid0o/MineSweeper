- **Dark/Light theme**: Easy on the eyes at any time of day
- **Hint system**: Stuck? Use up to 3 hints (but use them wisely!)
- **Sound effects**: Immersive gameplay experience
- **High score tracking**: Compete against yourself!
- **Game statistics**: Track your progress and success rate

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Left click**: Reveal a square
2. **Right click**: Place a flag on potential mines
3. **Clear all non-mine squares to win!**

The numbers show how many mines are adjacent to each square - use your logic!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows
```bash
# Just double-click Minesweeper.exe in the windows-app folder
# OR
python minesweeper.py
```

### Linux
```bash
# Navigate to linux-app folder and run:

```

## 🛠️ Building from Source

See [BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed steps to build executables for both Windows and Linux.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Start with corners and edges - they often have fewer adjacent mines
- When you're confident about a mine location, flag it immediately
- If you're stuck, try the hint feature - but use sparingly!
- Toggle dark/light mode based on your preference
